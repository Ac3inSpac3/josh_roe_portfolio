# PID Line Following Robot

## Introduction
In the EGB 220 project, our interdisciplinary team developed a PID Controlled Line Following Robot, focusing on precision and modularity. My role involved leading the design for the robot chassis as well as the sensor array. I was also responsible for programming an efficient PID line following algorithm. The robot featured a custom IR sensor array and a custom-designed PCB. Overcoming challenges like PCB design, sensor calibration and environmental factors, the final product exemplified a high-performing robotic solution, showcasing smooth, accurate line following capabilities, light weight chassis and fully functional custom PCBs.
