# Custom 3D Printer Running Klipper

## Introduction

I used the Annex K3 as a base printer design. I re-designed the majority of the printer (excluding the motor mounts) to make use of components I already had. This re-design allowed for a 200mmx200mm bed, a Revo hotend and a large touch screen running Klipper Screen.

## Features

Has 4 drive motors for X and Y (2 for each Axis) and 3 independent Z Motors for Z-Tilt adjust.
Integrates a magnetically attachable bed probe for mesh bed leveling.
