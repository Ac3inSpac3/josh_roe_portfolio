## About Me:
Hello, I’m Josh, a passionate undergrad Mechatronics Engineer with a strong interest in [specific areas of interest, e.g., robotics, automation, AI]. Working towards a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours majoring in Mechatronics) and Information Technology, I have developed a solid foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of engineering. My journey has been marked by a curious and innovative spirit, leading me to work on diverse projects ranging from robotic systems to advanced development prototypes.

I thrive on challenges and enjoy the process of conceptualizing, designing, and implementing solutions that push the boundaries of technology and creativity. This portfolio showcases a selection of my projects, reflecting my skills in areas like CAD design, programming in C#, C++, and Python, and hands-on experience with tools like Altium Designer and MATLAB.

Feel free to explore my work, and don’t hesitate to reach out for collaborations or discussions!
