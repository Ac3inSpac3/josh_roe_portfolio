# PID Line Following Robot

### Summary:
In the EGB 220 project, our interdisciplinary team developed a PID Controlled Line Following Robot, focusing on precision and modularity. My role involved leading the design and programming, implementing an efficient PID algorithm and creating a versatile, 3D-printed chassis. The robot featured a sophisticated IR sensor array and a custom-designed PCB. Overcoming challenges like PCB design and sensor calibration, the final product exemplified a high-performing robotic solution, showcasing smooth, accurate line following capabilities.
